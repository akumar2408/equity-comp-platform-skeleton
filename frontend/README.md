# Frontend

This directory contains the React + Vite frontend for the Equity‑Comp Platform skeleton.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite dev server and open a browser window at http://localhost:5173.

## Project Structure

- `src/components/DummyDashboard.tsx` – a simple placeholder dashboard component demonstrating how to add React components.

## Build

To create an optimized production build:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate static files in the `dist` directory.
